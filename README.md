### Description

This is to show a battle system for a RPG. I seen some good code'd ones on this site, but the graphics or styles of it were just sick. So I took some from Final Fantasy 3, and made a complete design of a battle engine.

Wow it's been more then a year since I updated this. If you want you can check my new site FoxGear.Net or my own PHP Game at FoxWar.Com.
 
### More Info
 
Attack Screen might be hid from the main form. I should redo the whole thing since I made it 3 years ago and know so much more now. Possibly finally make it so you could walk around and get into a battle :)
